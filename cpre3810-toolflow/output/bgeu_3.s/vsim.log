# ** Warning: (vopt-10587) Some optimizations are turned off because the +acc switch is in effect. This will cause your simulation to run slowly. Please use -access/-debug to maintain needed visibility. The +acc switch would be deprecated in a future release.
# ** Error (suppressible): ../../proj/src/TopLevel/RISCV_Processor.vhd(288): (vopt-1271) Bad default binding for component instance "CTRL: Control".
#  (Component generic "DATA_WIDTH" is not on the entity "work.Control".)
#  (Entity is selected because it is in the same library as the design unit that contains the component.)
# ** Error (suppressible): ../../proj/src/TopLevel/RISCV_Processor.vhd(320): (vopt-1130) Port "i_imm13bit" of entity "extender" is not in the component being instantiated.
